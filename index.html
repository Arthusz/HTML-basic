        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Izuku Midoriya (緑みどり谷や出いず久く Midoriya Izuku?), also known as Deku (デク Deku?), is the main protagonist of the
            My Hero Academia manga and anime series.

        </p>
        <p>Even though Izuku was born Quirkless, he manages to catch the attention of the legendary hero All Might due
            to his innate heroism and a strong sense of justice, and has since become his close pupil, as well as a
            student in Class 1-A at U.A. High School. All Might passed on his transferable Quirk to Izuku, making him
            the ninth holder of One For All.

        </p>
        <p>Following the Paranormal Liberation War, with Tomura Shigaraki and All For One actively targeting Izuku for
            his Quirk, he decides to leave U.A. before finishing his first year to keep his classmates out of harm's
            way.[4] After encouragement from his friends, he later returns to U.A.
